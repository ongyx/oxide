# oxide

Interpreted programming language with a runtime written in rust.

oxide is the successor of [ox], a previous effort to create a programming language in Python.
Both oxide and ox share a syntax that is inspired by [Cub].

Like CPython and Cub, oxide compiles down into bytecode before being executed in a virtual machine.
The code pipeline looks like this:

1. Tokenise (`&str` -> `Vec<Token>`)
2. Parse (`Vec<Token>` -> `AST`)
3. Compile (`AST` -> `Vec<Bytecode>`)
4. Execute (inside the VM runtime)

oxide is my first foray into Rust (and I'm still learning),
so feel free to open PRs or issues if you have suggestions/improvements to contribute.

## Setup

oxide currently does not use any nightly features, so it is recommended to use the stable toolchain: `rustup default stable`

Tests pass on rustc 1.59.0 (latest stable), but you may install the beta or nightly toolchains to test oxide for regressions.

To test, just run `cargo test`.

## Debugging

[pegviz] comes in handy when debugging the AST. Install it, and then run:

`cargo run --features trace <file> | pegviz -o trace.html`

to generate a graphical trace of the rules matched.

## Todo

- [x] AST parser
- [x] Type system
- [ ] Bytecode compile (from AST)
- [ ] Bytecode execution
- [x] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Interactive interpreter?
