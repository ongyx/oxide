# cub

This folder contains source code files for testing, copied over from the [Cub] repo.

These files have been modified to remove Cub syntac not supported in oxide, namely:

- `returns`: Functions need not be marked as returning.

The following folders were copied over:

* `examples`: `Source examples/`
* `source`: `Tests/CubTests/Test source files/`
* `misc`: `Sources/Cub/Standard Library/Sources/`, `macOS Example/macOS Example/`
